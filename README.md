## GOAL

Develop a tool that will help lenders to predict which loans are more likely to become delinquent so that they can take necessary steps to mitigate those risks. We are focusing on secured loans only (car, house and home improvement).


## JUSTIFICATION

This tool will be valuable for financial institutions looking to improve profitability and lower the risk of their loan portfolio.
